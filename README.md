# FPP01 - Palindrome
## Escaping Tutorial Hell with Question Driven Development.

Takes a single command line argument and checks three things:
1. Is the argument a valid string with no numbers, symbols, spaces, etc?
2. Is there only one argument (besides also the file name)?
3. Is the string a palindrome?

The program will declare whether the string is or is not a palindrome.
